GitHub Upload Instructions
==========================

1. Check current status:
   git status

2. Stage all changes:
   git add .

3. Commit changes:
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"

4. Push to remote repository:
   git push

   OR if pushing for the first time:
   git push -u origin dev

5. If you encounter branch name issues (Dev vs dev):
   git push -u origin Dev:dev

Pushing to Main Branch (When Ready):
=====================================

1. Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to dev:
   git status
   git push

2. Switch to main branch:
   git checkout main

3. Pull latest changes from main:
   git pull origin main

4. Merge dev into main:
   git merge dev

5. Push to main:
   git push origin main

6. Switch back to dev for continued work:
   git checkout dev

Tips:
- Always check git status before committing
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Pull changes before pushing if working with others: git pull
- Current branch: dev (make sure you're on the correct branch)
- Test thoroughly on dev before merging to main
